          <p>Masti is a pop-up noodle truck built on one simple idea: food should make you feel something. Whether it's joy, nostalgia, or the thrill of trying something bold, we believe great flavors spark great moments. What started as a playful experiment between friends has grown into a rolling celebration of noodles, spice, and good vibes that follows the city's energy wherever it goes.</p>
          <p>Our menu is inspired by the comforting instant noodles we all grew up loving, reimagined with fresh ingredients and global street-food influence. Every bowl begins with our signature Masti noodles, tossed in sauces ranging from tangy to fiery to creamy. We craft each dish to be quick enough for busy days yet flavorful enough to slow you down and make you smile. It's everyday comfort, elevated with a punch of personality.</p>
          <p>As a pop-up, Masti isn't just about food — it's about discovery. We set up at markets, festivals, parks, and unexpected corners of the city, creating small pockets of warmth and excitement. Regulars chase us down, newcomers stumble upon us, and everyone leaves with a full stomach and a little extra joy. The spontaneity of our locations is part of the fun: you never know where we'll be next, but you'll always know the vibe.</p>
          <p>At the heart of Masti is a love for community and good times. We aim to be more than a food truck — we're a gathering spot for friends, families, and flavor-seekers. Whether you're grabbing lunch between classes, fueling a night out, or seeking comfort in a steaming bowl of noods, we're here to bring the masti, one slurp at a time.</p>
